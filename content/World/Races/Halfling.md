	- **Riders**: Halflings traverse long distances on their loyal mounts, giving them access to a Find Steed with an *instant* cast time. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. In addition, they gain advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks.
	- **Speak with Small Beasts**: Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. Halflings love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.
