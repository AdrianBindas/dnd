	- **Mimicry**: You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
	- **Carrion Sense**: Many Kenkus have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. While their sense of smell isnâ€™t as keen as that of other species, it is particularly attuned to the scent of injuries or death. This gives them ability to detect presence and approximate location of a corpse or badly wounded creatures (50% or fewer hit points) that is located up to 1km away.
	- **Avian Origins**: Your feathery upper appendages allow you to fly over short distances. You can have a flying speed equal to your walking speed but you have to finish your turn on a hard surface or object.
	- **Star Fascination**: Many Kenkus are mesmerized by the view of stars and they are deeply ingrained in their mythology. As a consequence, you can estimate your time, location and cardinal directions whenever you have a clear view of the stars.
