	- **Psychic**: You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
	- **Grasping Tongue**: As a bonus action, you can target an object you can see that weighs less than 5 lbs and is up to 15 feet away and attempt to pull it to you. If the object isnâ€™t being worn or carried you automatically succeed. If a creature is currently wearing or holding the object you must instead roll a contested strength check to determine whether you pull the item from their person.
