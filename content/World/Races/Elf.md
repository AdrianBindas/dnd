> A schism has befallen a great nation of Elves. Two brothers, going their separate ways - the Elves of the Cities accustomed to the way of the men, and Elder Elves living true to the name of their fathers, one with  nature. Ever since the times of our forefathers, the elves living in the stone cities of men have longed to reunite with their long forgotten brothers. Elders are whispering about an eluding elven homeland, children are singing rhymes of great sorcerers and druids living with the tall, ancient trees. And everyone asks the same question - where have the Elder Elves gone?
