- magic resides in a place called Labyrinth
	- Labyrinth is a 'default' state of being, the original state of matter
	- Labyrinth is infinite and split into different branches, each concerning different fields
		- e.g. death, life, nature, fire, shadows...
- Living world was created as an 'artifact' or 'anomaly'
	- many worlds were created and perished and so will this world
- Magic is similar to an organism and is the most powerful force in the universe
- Grants consciousness and soul
- Every living creature or plant contains 'magic'
- Closer affiliation to magic grants abilities to manipulate matter and prolong life
- Prolonged exposition is corrupting, physically and mentally
- Magic is accessed using various rituals and items (wizards, artificers, bards), pacts with beings from Labyrinth (paladins, clerics, warlocks) or from the environment (druids) and blood (sorcerer).
- Magic was first accessed using old elven rituals
	- this made elves long living
	- old rituals were eventually forgotten
- Eventually influence of magic was too great and old Gods disappeared 
- Gods do not exist anymore, instead Ascendants took their places
