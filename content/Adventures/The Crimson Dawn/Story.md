Heroes wake up during an ancient eldritch ritual.
*Some kind of pressure on heroes is applied.*
The cultists have ties to the powerful realm.
The cultists plot a 'Crimson Dawn', overthrowing rulers and getting control of the capital.
The Crimson Dawn is a ritual that brings back one of the Old Gods.
Heroes get into the capital, caught in a turmoil of nationalistic rebels and unrest. 
Each species and culture demands its own nation.
A serial murderer is ravaging through the capital.
One part of city is under military lockdown due to unrest.
Heroes will deal with different factions and species in order to bring down the government.
The situation can be handled in a peaceful manner - diplomatic meeting or using force.
