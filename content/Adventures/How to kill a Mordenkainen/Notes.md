> 'Mordy's named spells really high light his personality. He was infamous for utilizing non damaging spells, creatively "ruining" encounters, refusing to get his hands dirty, abhoring the tedium of mortal life, and surviving 100s of tpks (largely by abandoning the party). And you can be devious with his named spells. Faithful hound takes no concentration. If mordy knows you're coming (he'll know), he can set traps with them (like force caging a PC surrounded by 8 of them). Bend the rules and have magnificent mansion on a contingency, or allow him to cast it at will(potentially beating PCs by simply ignoring them, mordy's signature move on the table and in lore. The amount of times he has "conveniently" not been around for attempts on his life is ridiculous. Divination wiz is definitely thematic to his class, even if I think he is technically is a conjurer).
